		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p> I am a former Apple Technician with a background in Mathematics, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering. My passion is product design and have been a TA in product design at MIT for the past 4 years. I am currently pursuing my masters in IT with a concentration in Software Engineering. </p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p> I am taking this course for several reasons. I want to strengthen my understanding of back end web design. I want to deversify my programming knowledge. Mostly, I want to learn data scraping techniques in attempts of being able to manipulate data and represent it in interesting ways visually or otherwise. </p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
		<p> I honestly have 0 previous experience with HTML/CSS. I've learned about it only superficially through the course of pursuing other programming hobbies. </p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p> I have dabbled in C++, Java, Objective C, OCaml, Ruby, and Python </p>
		
		<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
		<p> I have not. </p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p> I am working on a Mac. </p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p> My main reason for pursuing my masters in Software Engineering at this point is to complement Hardware Engineering. I love working with microcontrollers such as Arduinos, Rasberry Pi's, XBees, etc and I was hoping to explore interfacing that with dynamic web apps. </p>
