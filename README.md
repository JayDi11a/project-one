Description:

A simple website that gives an introduction about myself and helps identify my objectives of taking this class to the instructors.

Details for teaching team:

questionaire.php was the file I named to create the site. For some reason, when I pushed to pagoda, I managed to spell the path incorrectly when my computer autocorrected it and managed to cause the process to fail. I actually have to wait till the Pagoda support fixes it.


Outside Code:

Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com
